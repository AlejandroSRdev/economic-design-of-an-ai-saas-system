# 04 — Conversion and Plan Distribution Assumptions

## Why Model Conversion Before Launch?

Unit economics in AI systems are highly sensitive to conversion rates.

Small variations in:

- Trial-to-paid conversion
- Plan distribution
- User intensity segmentation

can significantly alter margin sustainability.

Even without real user data, conversion assumptions were necessary to validate structural viability.

## Conversion Rate Selection (18%)

The selected global conversion rate was 18%.

This value was not arbitrary.

It was derived from:

- Observed benchmarks of AI-based subscription products
- Short trial models (1–3 days)
- Low-cost subscription tiers
- Early-stage SaaS conversion patterns

Reported industry examples ranged approximately between:

- 10% (conservative case)
- 30% (strong performing products)

18% was chosen as a midpoint scenario:

- Not optimistic
- Not defensive
- Operationally plausible

This provided a balanced simulation baseline.

## Internal Plan Distribution (65% / 25% / 10%)

Once converted users were modeled, distribution across tiers was estimated as:

- 65% Mini
- 25% Base
- 10% Pro

This allocation reflects:

- Majority preference for lowest entry tier
- Moderate adoption of mid-tier for active users
- Limited but meaningful uptake of high-tier plans

The structure ensures:

- Accessibility for price-sensitive users
- Upsell potential
- Margin amplification through Pro tier

## Why Not Model Extreme Scenarios?

The objective was not to prove best-case growth.

The objective was to validate:

> Is the system structurally viable under reasonable, non-optimistic assumptions?

By selecting a midpoint conversion rate,  
the simulation avoided:

- Inflated projections
- Overconfidence bias
- Unrealistic scaling assumptions

The economic model was designed for sustainability first, not aggressive forecasting.

---

## Strategic Positioning

Conversion modeling was treated as:

- A structural validation tool
- A margin protection mechanism
- A decision-making framework

Not as a growth prediction exercise.

This distinction is critical.

The goal was not to forecast success.

The goal was to avoid structural failure.
