# Strategic Decision — Rejection of Freemium Model

## Initial Consideration

A freemium model was initially evaluated as a potential growth strategy.

The logic appeared attractive:

- Large user base
- Low conversion rate
- Monetization through paid tiers or ads

However, generative AI introduces a structural constraint:

> Every interaction carries direct marginal cost.

Unlike traditional SaaS systems with mostly fixed infrastructure costs,  
AI-based products incur variable API expenses per user action.

## Structural Pricing Constraint

The product category imposed a natural pricing ceiling.

Given the type of functionality offered:

- The subscription could not be positioned as premium/high-ticket.
- Pricing had to remain accessible.
- Low-cost tiers were necessary for market coherence.

This limited the maximum Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).

In such a context, freemium sustainability becomes heavily constrained.

Even if a higher subscription price might theoretically offset free-user cost,
that pricing strategy would not align with:

- Product scope
- Perceived value
- Target user expectations

Therefore, price escalation was not a viable solution.

## Conversion Reality in Freemium Models

Industry benchmarks suggest freemium conversion rates typically range between:

- 5% (common scenario)
- 10% (strong scenario)

Simulations were conducted under these realistic assumptions.

Under 5–10% conversion:

- Paid users could not offset the API cost generated by the free user base.
- Heavy free users disproportionately eroded margin.
- Ad-based monetization proved insufficient to compensate for variable AI cost.

In most modeled scenarios, the system resulted in:

> Structural negative margin.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Freemium only approached sustainability under:

- Optimistic and unlikely conversion rates
- Severe usage restrictions
- Minimal feature exposure
- Thin residual margin

Even then, the model remained fragile:

- Highly sensitive to provider price changes
- Vulnerable to usage spikes
- Unsuitable for limited capital conditions

---

## Capital Constraint Consideration

Without venture backing or external capital,  
operating at a structural loss for growth was not viable.

AI systems amplify burn rate due to variable cost exposure.

Therefore, growth needed to be:

- Controlled
- Sustainable from early stages
- Margin-aware

---

## Strategic Alternative

The system pivoted to:

- Low-cost paid tiers
- Short, controlled trial
- Explicit usage limits per plan
- Clear internal energy ceilings

This structure:

- Preserved accessibility
- Protected margin
- Reduced volatility
- Aligned revenue directly with usage

---

## Strategic Principle

In AI-based systems with low ARPU and variable cost exposure:

> Freemium without capital backing is structurally unstable.

The rejection of freemium was not ideological.
It was the result of quantitative modeling, pricing constraints and capital reality assessment.

Sustainability was prioritized over user volume.
